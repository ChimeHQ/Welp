# Welp
Tooling for macOS help books.

The help book format for macOS is effectively abandoned. Yet, it still remains one of the best ways to deliver in-app help content. Nearly all of the built-in macOS apps use it. But, it can be a real struggle. Welp is all about building tooling to make the process easier.

The project has five components:

- `Welp` library for working with help books programmatically
- `welp` cli tool for help book automation
- `Help Book.xctemplate` an Xcode template that sets up a help book bundle target
- `WelpBook` a (very) experimental library that replaces the help book format entirely

I have some [JavaScript](Help\ Book.xctemplate/helpbook.js) here that is needed to drive the in-browser navigation system. It does not work quite yet, and I also do not know the best way to distribute it. If you have ideas here, I'd love some help!

## Installation

Welp is available as both a command-line tool and a library.

Tool:

```
brew tap ChimeHQ/Welp https://github.com/ChimeHQ/Welp.git
brew install welp
```

Package:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ChimeHQ/Welp", branch: "main")
],
targets: [
    .target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: ["Welp"]),
	.target(name: "MyOtherTarget", dependencies: ["WelpBook"]),
]
```

## Tool Usage

*forthcoming - tool needs to be built first*

## Template Usage

First, the template must be installed. The on-disk path determines where Xcode displays it in its UI. These instructions place it in `macOS` > `Other`, under the `Project Templates` main group.

```bash
cd Welp
mkdir -p ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Project\ Templates/macOS/Other
cp -r Help\ Book.xctemplate ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Project\ Templates/macOS/Other/
```

## WelpBook Usage

Please do keep in mind this is experimental. This provides an interface to the `NSUserInterfaceItemSearching` API.

```swift
Help.register(Help.Handlers(items: searchItems, allTopics: allTopics))

func searchItems(_ query: String, limit: Int) async -> [Help.Item] {
    // perform your query and produce at most `limit` items
    
    return items
}

@MainActor
func allTopics(_ query: String) {
    // Handle the "Show All Help Topics" items for a given query string 
}
```
